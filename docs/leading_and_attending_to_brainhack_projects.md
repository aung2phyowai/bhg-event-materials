# *How to* Guideline for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects

## Before You Start

Here we aim to collect advices and suggestions currated from the many previous years' project leaders and attendees as the best practices
of running successful, collaborative projects that would lead high impact and successful outputs in the given short amount of time. The 
main aim of the Brainhacks is being inclusive, removing the borders and limits and increasing the information and experience exchange 
between the members of the project members. In the light of these aims, we encourage and support each single individual to be part of 
the whole event either as a project leader or attendee to get the highest benefit from the event.

This document will be developed over time with the feedbacks. Please bear with us, we will work on finishing the document soon. In the mean
