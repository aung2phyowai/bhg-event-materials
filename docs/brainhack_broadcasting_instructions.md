# Broadcasting your Brainhack

Hello, brainhacker! First of all, thank you for your interest in broadcasting
your Brainhack - this is what makes the community stronger!

This guide is both a primer on the resources you will need and a first steps
guideline to successfully broadcast your Brainhack. Note that is not intended
to be a complete, self-contained guideline for every possible broadcasting
tool.

You will need to gather the necessary equipment, take the necessary steps to
configure the required system of your choice, and test the setting a few days
before the event.

## Broadcasting Equipment

In order to broadcast your Brainhack, make sure you have the following
equipment:

1. **Camera**. You will need a tripod to hold the camera. If you have no
access to a camera, you may want to use a webcam, although the quality of your
broadcast is likely not to be satisfying.
2. **Audio/Microphone**. Ideally a wireless microphone will be required for the
speakers. This allows to minimize the ambient noise and thus to improve the
audio quality. Note that during the question time, it is recommended that the
speaker repeats the question to improve the experience both for the on-site
attendees and the live audience.
3. Light. Make sure that the projection screen have an appropriate lighting
conditions both for the on-site ateendees and the live audience.
4. Internet connection.

## Broadcasting Procedure

This guide assumes that the event will be broadcasted using a YouTube channel.
Although the broadcasting procedure may vary depending on the software you use
or the resources you have, you will generally want to:

1. Set up the broadcasting software.
2. Set up the YouTube Live dashboard.
3. Sync YouTube with the broadcasting software.
4. Go live
   1. Assess quality
   2. Manage comments.
5. Finish the broadcasting.
6. Publish the videos.

In order to broadcast you Brainhack, and depending on the options offered by
your broadcasting software, you may want to
- Cover both the speaker and the projection screen within the same view.
- Directly broadcast the slides and use a smaller region on top with the
  recording view of the speaker.
